# Algorithms Information

At the moment, there are not complex algorithms implemented, I am just practicing.

Actually, I have programmed these:
- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](/algorithms/sieve-of-eratosthenes.py) **(Python)**--> This is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. You have to input a n number for generate a list of numbers between 2 and n (both included). We have to run through list removing multiples of prime numbers and will finish when we compared last mark (the square of the selected number must be less or equal than n). The result will be a list of the prime numbers between 2 and n. More information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
